Postman:

workspace -> share other team memebers
collection -> container that is saved the requests. Folder
environments -> you can set up different set up. You can execute same test cases with different environment.
Logs -> View > Show Console // you can see logs
Programming -> Pre-requests Script (Java script) & Tests tabs


We used https://thetestingworldapi.com/ url for test on Postman
 POST -> http 201
 PUT, GET, DELETE -> http 200


Collection: (Test Suits)
-> to save your test cases you should use collection
-> containers that has saved test cases
-> you can add folder or subfolder
-> execute, share or publish collections

Collection documentattion -> publishe this documentation, there are several language versions

Run Complete Collection with single click
 Click Run Folder or Run Collection button
 Select test cases that you want to Run
 Scheduled, iteration,  run is exist
 You can see passed and failed tests & Summary


Environments:
    Dev -> for developer & unit testing
    QA Env -> for stage testing
    UAT -> user acceptance env
    Prodcution -> released env

    You define some env variables to run test on different env

    DEfine env variabled
    integrate env variabled to test cases
    also dev has export option
    When run collection, you can select env also
    You can fetch, update, create env variable on the test tab -> This can be used Postman TA instead of Manual testing on the Postman (request chainning)

Global Variables:
    for example: Licence number
    common for all environments
    set data in POSTMAN level
    use global variable same as Env Variables
    if same name variable on the env and global, postman firstly checks the env, after that checks the global variables
